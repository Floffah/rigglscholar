## Info
This app is still being development but as I code it, i will push my changes. Feel free to have a look around while I develop it.

In order to test this on your own machine, clone the repository and run `npm install` and then you should run `npx electron-rebuild` before running. If you want to change the styles while testing, run `npm run dev` and to test it run `npm start`.
This repo does not include the fonts but the code currently is programmed to use Open Sans from Google Fonts and was downloaded via [get-google-fonts](https://npmjs.org/package/get-google-font)
